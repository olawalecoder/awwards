📖 Why I Built This
This project started as a learning exercise. I followed an inspiring YouTube tutorial to explore modern UI/UX techniques and challenge myself to recreate and expand upon what I learned.

Through this journey, I gained hands-on experience with scroll-triggered animations, geometric transitions, and responsive design, turning this into more than just a tutorial follow-along—it became a foundation for building engaging, interactive websites.

I’m excited to share this project and continue learning and creating!
