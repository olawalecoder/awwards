## üìñ Why I Built This  

This project started as a learning exercise. I followed an inspiring **YouTube tutorial** to explore modern UI/UX techniques and challenge myself to recreate and expand upon what I learned.  

Through this journey, I gained hands-on experience with **scroll-triggered animations**, **geometric transitions**, and **responsive design**, turning this into more than just a tutorial follow-along‚Äîit became a foundation for building engaging, interactive websites.  

I‚Äôm excited to share this project and continue learning and creating!
