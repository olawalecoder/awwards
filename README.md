Why I Built This
This project started as a learning exercise. I discovered these techniques through an amazing YouTube tutorial and decided to challenge myself by recreating and expanding on what I learned. It’s been an exciting journey into the world of modern UI/UX design, where I explored how animations, transitions, and responsiveness can elevate user experiences.

Now, this isn’t just a learning milestone—it’s a foundation for creating visually engaging, interactive websites. I’m thrilled with how it turned out and excited to keep building and learning even more.
